# Software & System V&V Artifacts

This folder contains sample Verification & Validation (V&V) artifacts that demonstrate practical application of the **V-model**, **IEC 62304**, **ISO 13485**, and FDA expectations for software documentation in regulated medical devices.

The examples here represent typical deliverables produced during:
- Software Requirements Definition
- Test Case Design
- Interface & System-Level Verification
- Traceability Management
- Risk-Informed V&V Planning

All artifacts are original, simplified examples inspired by industry best practices—not derived from proprietary work.

## Folder Contents

### ** SRS Sample (Software Requirements Specification)**
Located in `SRS/`

Includes:
- Functional and non-functional requirements  
- Interface assumptions  
- Derived requirements  
- Risk-linked requirements  
- Acceptance criteria  

The SRS demonstrates clarity, testability, and traceability expected in regulated environments.

---

### ** Test Cases**
Located in `test_cases/`

Contains:
- Positive, negative, and boundary tests  
- Structured, step-based format  
- Expected results tied to requirements  
- Risk-based coverage examples  

Follows common medical device conventions:
- Unique test IDs  
- Trace links to SRS  
- Preconditions & postconditions  
- Objective/expected behavior  

---

### ** Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM)**
Located in `RTM/`

Includes a sample RTM mapping:
- **SRS → Test Cases**
- **Risk Controls → Verification**
- **Interfaces → Verification**

Demonstrates:
- End-to-end traceability  
- Visibility of untested/untraced items  
- Coverage completeness

##  Purpose of These Artifacts

These examples showcase competencies important to **Systems**, **Software V&V**, and **Design Assurance** roles in the medical device industry:

### ✔ Requirements decomposition & clarity  
### ✔ V-model alignment (SRS → TC → RTM)  
### ✔ Traceability discipline  
### ✔ Test case design in a regulated environment  
### ✔ Understanding of risk-driven testing  
### ✔ Familiarity with IEC 62304 documentation expectations

## Engineering Approach Highlighted

The artifacts reflect industry-standard thinking:

- **Defining requirements** with measurable acceptance criteria  
- **Designing verification** that catches defects early  
- **Linking requirements to risks** (ISO 14971 mindset)  
- **Maintaining traceability** to support audits and submissions  
- **Documenting verification steps cleanly** so teams can reproduce results

## Intended Role Alignment

These examples support my growth in roles such as:
- **Systems Engineer**  
- **Software V&V Engineer**  
- **Design Assurance / Quality Engineer**  
- **Cybersecurity Engineer (with V&V crossover)**  

They build on my experience in regulated software development and expand my capabilities in structured, audit-ready documentation.
