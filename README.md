# Medical Device Systems, V&V, and Cybersecurity Engineering Portfolio

This repository showcases hands-on engineering artifacts demonstrating **systems engineering**, **software V&V**, and **product cybersecurity** principles for regulated medical devices.  
All examples are inspired by real-world practices aligned with **FDA expectations**, **IEC 62304**, **ISO 14971**, **AAMI TIR57**, and modern product security workflows.

The goal of this portfolio is to provide clear, practical demonstrations of my engineering approach as I transition into systems, V&V, and cybersecurity roles within the medical device industry in the Chicago area.
