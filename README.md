# Medical Device Systems, V&V, and Cybersecurity Engineering Portfolio

This repository showcases hands-on engineering artifacts demonstrating **systems engineering**, **software V&V**, and **product cybersecurity** principles for regulated medical devices.  
All examples are inspired by real-world practices aligned with **FDA expectations**, **IEC 62304**, **ISO 14971**, **AAMI TIR57**, and modern product security workflows.

The goal of this portfolio is to provide clear, practical demonstrations of my engineering approach as I transition into systems, V&V, and cybersecurity roles within the medical device industry in the Chicago area.

## 🧪 Representative Artifacts

This repository includes examples such as:

- Threat model for an infusion pump  
- STRIDE matrix with mitigations  
- CVSS scoring sheet for selected threats  
- Software Requirements Specification (SRS) sample  
- Verification test cases written in a regulated style  
- Traceability Matrix (RTM) mapping requirements → tests  
- PowerShell / Python tools for log parsing and device checks  

None of the content is derived from proprietary work; all examples are original or based on publicly known device behaviors.

## 🎯 Purpose

This portfolio is part of my professional extention into a **Systems**, **V&V**, or **Cybersecurity Engineer** role within the Chicago medical device ecosystem.  
It demonstrates:

- Structured engineering thinking  
- Clear documentation skills  
- Familiarity with regulated development  
- Ability to analyze risk (functional + cybersecurity)  
- A proactive approach to continuous learning
